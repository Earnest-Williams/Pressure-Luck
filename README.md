# Pressure Luck

Pressure Luck is a strategic and fast-paced game where players test their intuition and luck. The goal is to accumulate points by making choices, but beware: pushing your luck too far could mean losing it all!

## Game Mechanics

### Objective
- Accumulate as many points as possible by making calculated choices.
- Decide when to "press your luck" for more points or "bank" your current score to avoid losing it.

### How to Play
1. **Turn Start**: Each player starts their turn with zero points for the round.
2. **Choices**:
    - **Press Your Luck**: Take a risk for more points. Each successful press adds points to your round score.
    - **Bank Points**: Secure your current round score to your total score and end your turn.
3. **Risks**:
    - If you "press your luck" and hit a penalty (e.g., a bad roll or unlucky draw), you lose all points accumulated in the current round and your turn ends.
    - If you bank your points, they are safe for the rest of the game.
4. **Winning the Game**: The game continues for a predetermined number of rounds or until a player reaches a target score. The player with the highest total score wins.

### Strategy Tips
- Know when to stop pressing your luck! Banking points often is safer, but bold moves can lead to victory.
- Pay attention to probabilities and penalties specific to your version of Pressure Luck.
